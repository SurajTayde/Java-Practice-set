# 🎮 Guess the Number

## 📖 Overview
"Guess the Number" is a fun and engaging Java-based project where the computer generates a random number, and the player must guess it correctly. The program provides hints to guide the user and incorporates optional features like scorekeeping, limited attempts, and multiple rounds for a more dynamic gameplay experience.

  - **Score Tracking**: Display and calculate scores based on attempts.
